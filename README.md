# Facespace!

## Goal

Create a site that will serve up Facespace! Oh, and learn a little more about Node, routing, EJS, and CSS along the way.

## Setup

- `yarn install`
- `yarn dev` to launch the server.

### About the Data

There is a file `/data/users.js` that contains an array of `user`s. Each user looks like this.

```js
{
  _id: '1008',
  name: 'Fletcher',
  friends: ['1006', '1007', '1009'], // array of the ids of user's friends
  avatarUrl: '/images/profile-pics/000003.jpg',
},
```

> ### About the CSS
>
> The project is coming to you entirely styled! Let me repeat that: **All of the CSS is done for you.** 游땸 I know, right! But because nothing is free, you will have to figure out the classes that go with each element. You are able to achieve the same look by assigning the css classes to the right element.

## The Workshop

### Exercise 1 - The Homepage

The homepage should show a grid of all of the users in the system.

#### 1.1 Create the homepage endpoint

//done

- Create a `GET` endpoint for the homepage.

```js
.get('/', handleHomepage)
```

- Declare the `handleHomepage` function, and send this `res`ponse:

```js
res.status(200).send("homepage");
```

Once you've added this right code, load the homepage at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). You should see this.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/homepage_1.png" />

#### 1.2 Create the `homepage.ejs` template

//done

- In `views/pages/` there is a file called `homepage.ejs`
- There are partials for the header and footer. Add those to `homepage.ejs`.
- Create a `div` with a class of `home-page`
- Create an `h2` with content "All Facespace members"

#### 1.3 Render the homepage

//done
To render the homepage, you will need to modify the `handleHomepage` function. Instead of `send`ing something, `render` the `homepage.ejs` file that you just updated.

You should now see this in the browser:

<img src="./__lecture/assets/homepage_2.png" />

#### 1.4 Render all of the users

First we need to pass the users data to the `ejs` template. When rendering an `ejs` template, we can pass it an object as the second argument that can contain anything we like. In this case, we want to pass the entire `users` array.

```js
res.status(200).render("pages/homepage", { users: users });
```

Once the data is available to the template, we need to loop through the array and render all of the images.

```html
<ul class="homepage__all">
  <% users.forEach(user => { %>
  <li class="homepage__all--user">
    <img src="<%= user.avatarUrl %>" />
  </li>
  <% }) %>
</ul>
```

You should now see this in the browser:

<img src="./__lecture/assets/homepage_3.png" />
q1 done
---

### Exercise 2 - The Profile Page

Create a profile page that will be unique to each user. Our endpoint should contain the user's `_id` as a `url param`, which will allow us to "know" which data to use.

#### 2.1 Create a users endpoint

//done
Create a `GET` endpoint that we can use to show the user's profile page. Your endpoint should start with `/users/` and end with a url param for the `_id`.

This endpoint will trigger a function `handleProfilePage` that you will need to create as well. For now, have that function `res.send` the `_id` that is in the url.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/profile_1.png" />

#### 2.2 Create the Profile Page and render it

In `/views/page/`, create a file called `profile.ejs`. This will be the page that we render, at the endpoint we created above.

Here is the beginning of the code, you will need for this file.

```html
<%- include('../partials/header') %>
<div class="profile-page">
  <%= user.name %>
</div>
<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
```

Convert the `res.send` you have in `handleProfilePage` to a `res.render` of that profile page.

Notice the temporary insertion of the `user.name` into the ejs template. You can use that to confirm that your endpoint is functioning properly. Currently, it should not be working. We need to send the user data to the `ejs` template.

Add the user's data to that object. You will need to figure out which user data to send based on the provided `_id` in the url params.

#### 2.3 Render all of the user's data to the page.

- Render the user's avatar, and name.
- Render the list of friends.

```html
<div>
  <h3><%= user.name %>'s Friends</h3>
  <ul>
    <!-- loop over the array of friends -->
    <!-- each friend's image and name should be visible. -->
  </ul>
</div>
```

#### 2.4 Create the HTML and CSS for the Profile page

Below is what the profile page should look like. While it doesn't need to be pixel-perfect, it should be close enough as to _not_ look different from the images below. I've provided the mobile version as well. Look at [`public/css/profile-page.css`](public/css/profile-page.css) Add the right classes to the right elements.

### Exercise 3 - The Sign in page

Our security system will be total crap, but will work for our purposes. True site security is too important for us to implement ourselves! When the time comes, we'll leverage code from experts in the field.

For this workshop, we're going to simply ask for the user's first name and if it's in the users array, we'll assume that that is the person that is logging in.

#### 3.1 Create the endpoint

In `server.js` we need to have an endpoint that will receive requests for the signin page. This endpoint will call a function called `handleSignin`. For testing purposes, do a `res.send('ok')` in that function. This will allow us to confirm that the signin endpoint works.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/signin_1.png" />

#### 3.2 Create the form

In `views/pages`, create a new file called `signin.ejs`. Add the following `ejs` code to the file. Take a few minutes to go over this code and make sure you understand what it's doing.

```html
<%- include('../partials/header') %>
<div class="signin-page">
  <form method="post" action="/getname" class="signin-page__form">
    <label for="firstName" class="signin-page__form--label">First name</label>
    <input
      type="text"
      name="firstName"
      placeholder="Your first name"
      class="signin-page__form--input"
    />
    <button type="submit" class="signin-page__form--button">Submit</button>
  </form>
</div>
<%- include('../partials/footer') %>
```

#### 3.3 Render the signin page.

The form we've just added doesn't yet render on the `/signin` page. We need to tell `handleSignin` to render that particular `ejs` page template.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/signin_2.png" />

#### 3.4 Receive the data from the form

Our form looks good but it doesn't yet do anything. We need the form to send the input to the server.

Notice that the form (in `signin.ejs`) has an `action` attribute. That is the endpoint that the form will contact when a user submits the form. Let's create a `POST` endpoint that will receive the data from the form.

```js
.post('/getname', handleName)
```

1. Define a variable `firstName` and assign the value of `req.body.firstName`. You can also write a temporary `console.log()` to make sure that your function works and that you have access to the value of `firstName`.

_Note: You will see `[Object: null prototype]` in the console, if you `console.log(req.body)`. This isn't an error. It is by design, but beyond the scope of the lesson. [More information here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56298481/how-to-fix-object-null-prototype-title-product)._

2. Use the `firstName` to `find()` that user's data in `users.js`. That array is already imported and available to you. (See line 6 of `server.js`).
3. If it exists redirect to that user's profile page.
4. If it doesn't exist, redirect to the signin page. (This is a reload of the signin page.)

We can redirect the browser to an endpoint with the following code.

```js
res.redirect("/the-endpoint");
```

5. You should also return a status code to the browser. Chain them as we did in previous workshops.

```js
res.status(200); // when the request is successful
res.status(404); // when the request is not successful. In this case, the user was not found.
```

### Exercise 4 Tying all of the pages together.

We now have a functioning app! 游뗿 Let's add more functionality to the make it better.

#### 4.1 - A link to the signin page in the header

We should have a link to the signin page in the header.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/signin_button.png" />

When the user is signed in, the "sign in" link should be replaced by a greeting and the user's name.

This will mean storing the user data in memory, and passing it to `header.ejs`. You can store the current user object in `currentUser` variable that is defined in the `server.js` file. _This will store the current user in the server memory until the server is restarted._

<img src="./__lecture/assets/signin_signedin.png" />

While you're in the header, it would be good to turn the title into a link to the homepage.

**Hint:** Passing data to a page template also makes it accessible all partials included that page.

#### 4.2 Faces on the homepage

- Faces on the homepage should link to that person's profile page.
- Let's also add a little UX tweak on hover. Give the image some sort of effect on hover.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/home-links.gif" />

#### 4.3 My Friends!

When a user is signed in and looking at the homepage, it would be great if there were some visual indication as to who their friends are in the grid of faces. My example is a ribbon on the image, but feel free to do whatever you like.

<img src="./__lecture/assets/homepage_4.png" />

#### 4.4 No Sign in for you!

If someone is already signed in, they should not be able to see the signin page. Currently, if a user signs in and navigates to http://localhost:8000/signin, they will see the sign in page.

Prevent this from happening.

### Stretch Goals

Here are some other features that you could add to the app. _None of these have any solutions._

- User can add/remove friends. _This should update the friends array of both users. Being friends is reciprocal._
- If a user adds a friend, they are not automatically added. The other user needs to accept this first. _It would be useful to create a new array of `pendingFriends` in the user object._
- A sign up page... that does exactly what you would expect.
- Don't like the orange theme, change it. Flex your CSS muscles!!
- What else can you think of?
